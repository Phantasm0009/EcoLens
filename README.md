# EcoLens – AI-Powered Waste Detection for Smart Recycling

EcoLens is an innovative application designed to promote sustainable waste management through the use of artificial intelligence and computer vision. By helping users identify and classify waste in real-time, EcoLens aims to reduce contamination in recycling streams and foster environmentally friendly habits.

## Project Overview

EcoLens provides a user-friendly interface for individuals, schools, and community centers to learn about proper waste disposal and recycling practices. The application leverages advanced AI models to classify waste items and offers gamified features to encourage consistent recycling behavior.

## Features

- **AI Waste Scanner**: Utilize your smartphone or webcam to scan and classify waste items into categories such as plastic, metal, glass, compost, and landfill.
- **Impact Tracker**: Monitor your eco-impact, including CO₂ saved and materials recycled, while competing in community-based rankings.
- **Model Training**: The application employs a fine-tuned image classification model, trained on comprehensive waste datasets to ensure accuracy.
- **Gamified Rewards**: Earn badges and unlock achievements for consistent recycling efforts, making sustainability engaging and fun.
- **Open API**: Cities and institutions can integrate EcoLens into their kiosks or smart bins, expanding its reach and impact.
- **Ethical AI Features**: The application includes explainable AI components to provide transparency in classification and a feedback loop to minimize bias in data labeling.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built using React for a responsive web interface, with potential for mobile support through Flutter.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Firebase for handling API requests and user data management.
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for implementing transfer learning with waste classification datasets.
- **Deployment**: The application can be deployed on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces, Render, or Vercel for demonstration purposes.
